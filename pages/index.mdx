# Introduction
 
Welcome to Bubblegum UI! This is basic documentation to help organize the components used to build the [Project Bubblegum](https://github.com/tayv/project-bubblegum) template. You can also use it as a starting point for your own project.

## What is Project Bubblegum?

### Part 1: The project

The Project Bubblegum template is a work-in-progress proof-of-concept for an interactive Markdown document builder. 
It uses the components documented here and is built using Next.js 13 and TypeScript.

### Part 2: Bubblegum UI components 

This is the collection of controlled React components with basic styling that's documented here. They're designed to be used with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI primitives.
